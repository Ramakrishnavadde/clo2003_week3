Learning about Linux

Introduction:Linux is an open source Operating system based on Linux Kernel which is well known for its security,reliability and flexibility.In this,we talk about Linux history,Linux distributions nd some of the Linux commands.

#Section1:Linux History:In 1990,Linus Torvalds was frustrated by the licensing of Minix, which is limited to educational use only. In 1991, he became curious about operating systems,So he began to work on his operating system kernel. Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on Minix and applications written for Minix were also used on Linux.
After not finding the POSIX documentation, Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on Minix and applications written for Minix were also used on Linux.Torvalds initiated a switch from his original license, which prohibited commercial redistribution, to the GNU GPL.In mid 1990 organizations such as NASA started to replace their increasingly expensive machines with LINUX and many companies started to use it.Richard Stallman and Torvalds has provided contributions to LINUX.
In modern Computing,Linux systems are used throughout computing, from embedded systems to virtually all supercomputers.In this modern world,all mobiles,tablets and some devices are using android and many gaming companies are using LINUX for their game development because its free and customizable.

#Section2:LINUX Distributions:Linux Distributions are the types of LINUX OS that uses LINUX kernel with  various software tools and libraries.Based on needs and prefernces many distributions were developed using software packages and utilizes together.Some of the examples are Ubuntu,Mint,Kali LINUX,Debian CentOS.

#Section3:BAsic Linux Comamnds:
ls:list all the files
cd:changes directory
mkdir:makes directory
rm:removes files
cp:copies files
mv:move files
